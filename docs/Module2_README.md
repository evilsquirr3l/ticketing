# Persistence Level (SQL, NoSQL) + DAL

The purpose of the module is to provide developers with the knowledge and skills to design and implement a data
persistence layer for an application. During the training, developers will learn about the different types of database
management systems (DBMSs), including SQL (relational databases) and NoSQL (non-relational databases), and the
advantages and disadvantages of each. They will also learn how to design a database schema that meets the needs of the
application and how to choose the appropriate DBMS for the job.

### What should be done

- Implement a data access layer for the designed database. All the CRUD operations must be implemented.
- Using the domain model description and Entity Relation (ER) model from module 1, design and implement a database using
  one of the approaches (database first, code first, or model first).

Note: Your mentor is the product owner, while designing database - ask your mentor for realization details. In addition,
discuss with your mentor additional requirements for DAL (Transactions, specific validation, query logging, etc.)
